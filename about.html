        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I have lived in Canada most of my life. I'm currently 19, turning 20 late this year. I feel like I'm beginning to grow more into my personality with age/ I'm a fun-loving guy who is down for anything. I'm the ftaher of my friend group and the responsible one when everyone is there to have a good time. I feel like everyone deserves a good time every once in a while. I have an infectiously positive attitude and like to make the people I surround myself with happier in most ways that I can. My frieds are my family and family is priceless! I'm still learning and growing as an individual and hope to take much of that attitude forward into my next many years of growth and learning!</p>
